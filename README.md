### "Friendships/create" aka follows, daily limitation:

https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/rate-limits

"POST friendships/create; window: 24 hours;	limit per user: 400"

### Notes

My understanding is that the rate limit on follows is separate from all other actions taken by an account.

If that is correct, you can run the follower scripts regardless of your account's other activity for the day.

However, since either one of them will use up all of your follows for the day, you can only use one.
