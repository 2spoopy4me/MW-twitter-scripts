### "Friendships/create" aka follows, daily limitation:

https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/rate-limits

"POST friendships/create; window: 24 hours;	limit per user: 400"

### Notes

My understanding is that the rate limit on follows is separate from all other actions taken by an account.

If that is correct, you can run the followerScript.py file regardless of your account's other activity for the day.
